Talent Protocol helps builders and creators get rewarded by making their reputation more visible.

We track builder activity across blockchains, GitHub, Twitter and other platforms, to calculate a [Builder Score](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Mb_Wi2wHgkerzhobNQn/s/WJyY4C57wYFZ4o1158L9/protocol-concepts/scoring-systems/builder-score) that helps ecosystems reward real contributors.
