# Authentication

## X-API-KEY

The API key is the entry point for the Talent API. In order to perform requests it needs to be passed on every request.

We use the header `X-API-KEY` to retrieve the access key and validate your access to our API.

There are two types of API key permissions:

- `read_only`: Can only access GET requests
- `write`: Can access all requests

### Tiers

API keys are assigned one of two tiers:

- **Free**: Default tier. Limited to 5,000 requests/month.
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited requests.

See [Rate Limits](/docs/talent-api/rate-limits) for details on usage tracking and headers.
