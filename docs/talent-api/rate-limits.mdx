# Rate Limits

## Tiers

API keys have two tiers with different usage limits:

| Tier | Monthly Limit | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Free** | 5,000 requests | Default tier for all new API keys |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | Unlimited access |

- Once the limit is reached, the API will block further requests with a `401` response.
- Usage counters reset automatically at the beginning of each month.

## Usage Headers

Every successful response for **free tier** API keys includes the following headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-API-Usage-Current` | Number of requests made in the current month |
| `X-API-Usage-Limit` | Monthly request limit (5,000) |
| `X-API-Usage-Status` | Current status: `ok`, `warning`, or `exceeded` |

Enterprise tier keys do not receive these headers.

## Usage Endpoint

You can check your API key's usage details at any time, even if your key has exceeded the limit:

```
GET /api_keys/usage
```

Pass your API key via the `X-API-KEY` header. The response includes:

```json
{
  "api_key_id": "uuid",
  "tier": "free",
  "current_usage": 150,
  "limit": 5000,
  "usage_status": "ok",
  "period": "2026-02",
  "resets_at": "2026-03-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

For enterprise keys, `current_usage` and `limit` will be `null`, and `usage_status` will be `unlimited`.

## Fair Use Policy

Unless explicit permission is given, the following activities are prohibited:

**Excessive Use**: Overuse of the API beyond the designated limits that impacts system performance or fairness for other users.

**Automated Abuse**: Using scripts, bots, or automated tools to excessively query the API, harvest data, or engage in any behavior that could overload our systems.

**Redistribution**: Reselling, sublicensing, or sharing your API Key with unauthorized third parties is strictly prohibited.

**Data Misuse**: Manipulating, distorting, or misrepresenting the data obtained from our API, or using the data for illegal purposes.

## Inactivity Clause

We reserve the right to **deactivate or cancel an API Key** if it has been inactive for more than **10 consecutive days**. Inactivity is defined as **no API requests** made during this period.
