## 1. Program Overview

## 4. Reward Structure

**First Distribution:**

- Rewards will be distributed proportionally to the Top 200 builders.

**Weekly rewards are distributed across three tiers:**

1. Tier 1: Top 10 builders share 50% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.
2. Tier 2: Next 25 builders share 25% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.
3. Tier 3: Next 65 builders share 25% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

Your ranking and rewards are determined by three separate factors:

1. Usage of WalletConnect and WalletConnect packages on that week
2. Verified contributions to public crypto repositories on that week
3. Activity on verified contracts you've deployed on Base on that week

The specific weights and formulas used to calculate rankings are proprietary and subject to change at the sole discretion of Talent.
