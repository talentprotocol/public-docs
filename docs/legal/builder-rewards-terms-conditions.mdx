## 3. Program Period

The Program begins on March 31, 2025. Weekly rewards reset every Monday at 12pm UTC.

## 4. Reward Structure

Weekly rewards are distributed across three tiers:

a) Tier 1: Top 10 builders share 50% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.

b) Tier 2: Next 25 builders share 25% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.

c) Tier 3: Next 65 builders share 25% of the reward pool, proportionally to their activity and impact.
