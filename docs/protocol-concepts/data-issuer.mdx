# Data Issuer

A Data Issuer is the trusted entity associated with a Data Point on Talent.

## Key Attributes:

- Represents the source of trust for the data (e.g., GitHub, Base, ENS).
- It can be distinct from the technical provider where Talent fetches the data from ([Accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account)).
- Some Data Issuers can also be [Accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account) (e.g., GitHub), while others are not (e.g., Base).
- Some [Accounts](/docs/protocol-concepts/account) can provide multiple data issuers (ex.: wallet address)
- A single Data Issuer can provide multiple [Data Points](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point).

## Examples:

- GitHub is both an Account (where we get the data from technically) and the Data Issuer (entity that we trust to issue reputation data to a subject).
- Base is a Data Issuer, with multiple Data Points (number of transactions, smart contracts deployed, ...), but it's not an Account. The account in this case is the wallet address.
