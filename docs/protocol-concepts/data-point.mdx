# Data Point

A Data Point is specific type of reputation data about a given user.

Explore data indexed by Talent at [https://talent.app/~/data](https://talent.app/~/data).

## Key Attributes:

- A Data Point provides a verified fact about a user's reputation at a given point in time.
- A Data Point is always associated with a [Data Issuer](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-issuer).
- A Data Issuer can have multiple Data Points, but a Data Point only has one Data Issuer.
- A Data Point only contains objective and verifiable data.
- A Data Point doesn't store any scoring information; they can be use in multiple scoring systems.
- Example:
  - Data Issuer: `GitHub`
  - Data Point: `Stars`
  - Value: `[number of stars]`

## **Variable** and **Immutable** Data Points:

- Immutable data points are simpler versions of variable data points.
- **Variable Data Points** contain a value that can change over time.
- Example: GitHub Stars, ETH Balance on Base
- **Immutable Data Points** are only set once, and never recalculated again.
- Example: Base Learn, KYC, First Transaction on Base

## Categories of Data Points:

- **Metrics**: Ongoing measurable activities (e.g., GitHub contributions, transactions)
- **Achievements**: One-time accomplishments and permanent credentials (e.g., a hackathon win)
- **Affiliations**: Memberships and group affiliations that can be lost or revoked (e.g., job or a DAO)
- **Accounts**: Social profiles and other verifications (e.g., twitter, farcaster, github)

## Scoring Tags

- We use a **tag-based system** that determines how data points are used in ranking systems such as [Builder Rank](/docs/protocol-concepts/builder-rank):
  - Initial tags: `human`, `builder`, `creator`
  - Data points can have multiple tags
  - Scoring systems use tags to determine which data points to include
