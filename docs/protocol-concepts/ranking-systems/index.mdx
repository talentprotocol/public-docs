# Ranking Systems

A Ranking System evaluates verified [Data Points](/docs/protocol-concepts/data-point) to determine a user's position relative to others in a specific domain.

Under the hood, each ranking system uses an internal scoring algorithm to convert Data Points into a final rank. The scores themselves are not exposed — only the resulting rank is made available through the API.

Talent intentionally separates Data Points (objective data) from Ranking Systems (subjective evaluation). Both are autonomous and composable protocol primitives.

## Available Ranking Systems

Multiple ranking systems can exist in parallel, each designed to evaluate talent in a specific domain:

- [Builder Rank](/docs/protocol-concepts/ranking-systems/builder-rank) identifies and ranks people creating software
- Other ranking systems coming soon

Each ranking system operates independently with its own set of relevant Data Points, tailored to what matters for their specific persona.

This modular approach allows Talent to serve different communities with metrics that genuinely reflect their unique contributions, rather than forcing diverse talents into the same box.
