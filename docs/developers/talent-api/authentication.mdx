# Authentication

## X-API-KEY

The API key is the entry point for the Talent Protocol API. In order to perform requests it needs to be passed on every request.

We use the header `X-API-KEY` to retrieve the access key and validate your access to our API.

There're two types of API keys:

* `read_only`: Can only access GET requests
* `write`: Can access all requests

## How to request an API key

You can request one API key by opening a ticket on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/talentprotocol).
